    These are general styles about the size of the element. You can adjust the size if you want.
    Keep in mind that if you do change the size you will have to adjust the left position inside of the keyframe.
    In I suggest doing 5px less than your element size for the left position. For example, here the width is 100px so I use
    a left position of 95px.
